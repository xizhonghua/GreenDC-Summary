Power Concern
---

### Cost concern
- Servers today consume ten times more power than they did ten years ago [[Epa-2007]](https://github.com/hxwang/Seminar/blob/master/Paper-Summary/US-EPA-Report-on-Server-and-Data-Center-Energy-Efficiency.md).
- The wordwide expenditure on enterprise power and cooling of these servers is estimated to be in excess of $30 billion [[Raghavendra-2009]](https://github.com/hxwang/Seminar/blob/master/Paper-Summary/RaR08-No-Power-Struggles-Coordinated-Multi-Level-Management-for-the-Data-Center.md)
- According to Dr. Eric Schmidt, ECO of Google, "what matters most to the computer designer at Google is not speed, but power, low power, because data centers can consume as much electricity as a city [[Markoff-2009]](https://github.com/hxwang/Seminar/blob/master/Paper-Summary/MarkoffL02_Intel's-Huge-Bet-Turns-Iffy.md)."
- Esimates for 2010 indicate that collectively datacenters consume around 1.5% of the total electricity used world-wide [Koomey-2011](http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html).


### Energy concern
- The high cost translates into high carbon emissions as most of this eletricity comes from fossile fuels. 

### Trend
- As the price of server hardware has remained relatively stable, energy cost becomes one of the primary components in the total cost of ownership for computer server systems in the data centers.
