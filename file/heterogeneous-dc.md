## Heterogeneous Data Center

### Intro
- Heterogeneity occurs because servers are gradually provided and replaced over the typical 15-year lifetime of a DC. At any point of time, a DC may host 3-5 server generations with a few hardware configurations per generation, in terms of the specific speeds and the capacities of the processors, memory, storage and networking subsystems.
  - Hence, it is common to have 10 to 40 configurations throughout the DC. Ignoring heterogneity can lead to significant inefficiencies, as some workloads are sensitive to the hardware configuraton.
