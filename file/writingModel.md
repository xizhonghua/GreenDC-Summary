## Sample Writing: Model Description

### Time
- discrete
  - The time interval is t \in {0,1,2,...,T} where T can be arbitrarily large. In practice, T can be a year and the length of a time slot &tau; could be as small as milliseconds for service requests (e.g., HTTP) or as large as several minutes for batch-like jobs (e.g., MapReduce) [[Adnan-2010]](../papers/AdnanS12_dynamic-deferral-geoDC.md).
