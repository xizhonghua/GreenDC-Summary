### Virtualized Cloud Environment
- [[Meng-2010]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1809052) proposed a joint-VM provisioning approach be exploiting *statistical multiplexing* among the workload patterns of multiple VMs, so that the unused resoruce of a low-utilized VM is borrowed by other co-located VMs with high utilization.
  - My comments: can be extend to combine heterogeneous workloads, renewable energy
- [[Steinder-2008]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4258530) takes advantage of virtualization features to co-allocated heterogeneous workloads on one server machine, thus reducing the granularity of resource allocation. 
  - My comments: this indicates that virtualization can increase system utilization!
- [[Eharqye-2010]](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.1468/pdf) developed a working prototype of a gramework for facilitating resource management in service providers, which allows both cost reduction and fulfill of the QoS based on SLAs. 
  - My comments: does this work consider mixed workloads?
