### Adapt workloads
As solar and wind energy are intermittent, which requires approaches for tackling the energy supply variability. One approach is to use batteies and/or the electricity grid as a backup for the renewable energy. It may also be possible to adapt the workload(the energy demand) to match the renewable energy supply
