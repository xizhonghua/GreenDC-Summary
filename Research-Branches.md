### Adapt workloads
- As solar and wind energy are intermittent, which requires approaches for tackling the energy supply variability. One approach is to use batteies and/or the electricity grid as a backup for the renewable energy. It may also be possible to **adapt the workload**(the energy demand) to match the renewable energy supply

- For highest benefits, green data center operators must intelligently manage their workloads and the sources of energy at their disposal. For example, when the workload is **deferrable**(i.e., it can be delayed within a time bound), it may be appropriate to delay some of the load, and store the freed-up reneable energy in the batteries for later use(e.g., to shave an expected load peak when the reneable energy is not available)[[Goiri-2013]](https://github.com/hxwang/Seminar/blob/master/Paper-Summary/GoiriIK13_Designing-and-Managing-Datacenters-Powered-by-Renewable-Energy.md).
