### Summary
- They explore whether the geographical load balancing can encourage use of "green" renewable energy and reduce the use "brown" fossile fuel energy. 
- They derive two distributed algorithms for achieving optimal geographical loading balancing.
- They show that if electricity is dynamically priced in proportion to the instantaneous fraction of the total energy that is borwn, then geographical load balancing provides significant reductions in brown energy use.
