### Carbon market dynamics
[Le-2010]() make the decision of cap-and-trade policy based on the market price of carbon offsets. Using real futures market data from [PointCarbon](), they find that
- although there can be periods of variability, the carbon prices exhibit consistent trends even at relatively short time scales
- it takes at least a few hours for price to change appreciably

These observation suggest that market-based decisions will be meaningful; excessive variability or the absence of clear trends could render our decision inadequate in just a short time.

In other words, the price is relatively stable in a short time, thus the scheduling scheme can be changed periodically.
