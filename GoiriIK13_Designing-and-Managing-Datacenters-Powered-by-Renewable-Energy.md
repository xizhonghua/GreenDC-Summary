 ### Summary
 This paper introduced the designing of a green data center.
 
 
 ### Parasol
 - the designed green data center, each compoenents of the data center is introduced
 - the cooling system works less than 1% of the time
 - the green energy consumption trend in a long time period
 - the data center's operation during hurricane Sandy demonstrate the potential for green datacenters to operate through **power outages** (or in remote locations without a reliable grid power source)
 
 ### GreenSwitch
 - it is a system for scheduling workloads, selecting the source of energy to use(renewable, battery, and/or grid), and/or selecting the renewable energy storage medium(battery or grid) at each point in time.
 - it seeks to minimize the overall cost of grid electricity (including both **grid energy** and **peak grid power**) while respecting the characteristics for the workload and battery lifetime constraints.
