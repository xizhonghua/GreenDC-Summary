## Peak Power


### Intro
- Datacenter also have to pay for their peak brown energy consumption, i.e., dollar amount per kW of borwn power at the highest period of borwn power usage. 

### Cost
- Even though  these charges have almost always been overlooked in the literature, the peak brown power charge can be significant, especially during the summer. [[Govindan-2011]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2000064.2000105) estimate that this component can represent up to 40% of the overall electricity cost of a datacenter.
