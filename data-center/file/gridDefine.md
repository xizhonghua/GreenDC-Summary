## Smart Grid

### Intro
Smart grid technology is a technology for the next generation powr grid--has recently been introduced to improve efficiency of the traditional 20th century powre grid. Smart grid rovides a feasible way for dynamic and efficient power management of data centers.


### Function
- distributed energy production
- integration with mass number of renewable energy sources
- self monitoring
- demand response
- self healing
- the use of communication technology to precisely match power generation with consumer demand

### Usage: power mangement of data centers
- Organizations such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and many other Internet based service operators (i.e., the owners of geographically distributed systems) could benefited by accessing smart grid's real-time states, such as power price, power demand, power availability, etc. Upon receiving such information, operators can respond accordingly, sometimes even interactively, to control and optimize many perormance criteria. 
  - e.g., operators could optimize their operational cost by dispatching workloads to the data centers where powre supply is abundant and the electricity price is lower.
  - e.g., operators could increase renewable energy usage and/or mitiate carbon emission by allocating workloads to the data centers where renewable energy is readily available. 
  
### Interation of Power Grid and Data Centers
The interation is *bilateral* and equally *beneficial* for both utilities.
- e.g., data centers may even earn some revenue by providing ancillary services to the power grids. 
  - Ancillary services: are mechanism/services used by the power grids to address normal variabilites in power consumption over time, and ensure resiliency in case of power plant or transmission line failtures. When power grid is under stress due to high power demand, the networked data centers can shift their workload to other lowe power demand region.
- in case of power failture data centers backup power generators and UPSs can be brought online to powr grid and supply local energy.
