## Smart Grid

- Ref: [[Rahman-2014]](../../papers/RahmanLK14_Survey-Geo-LoadBalancing.md)

### Why we need smart grid?
- In most of the countries, the long-serving electrical and distribution was designed a a **centralized unidrectional system** for electric power transmission and distribution. These power systems were neither designed to cope with high demand for energy, climate changes, seamless efficiency, rising fuel costs etc., nor to take advantage of latest power generation technologies. As a result the traditional power grids are very likely to reach their limitation soon.

### What is smart grid?
- Smart grid, also known as intelligent grid or modern grid, are envisioned to replace traditional grid by changing fundamentally the way the traditional power system works. The Energy Independence and Security Art(EISA) defines the smart grid as follows [[ISO-2009]](http://www.iso-ne.com/pubs/whtpprs/smart_grid_report_021709_final.pdf):
  - A modernization of the Nation's electricity transmission and distribution system to maintain a reliable and a secure electricity infrastructure that can meet future demand growth.
- Smart grid technology is a technology for the next generation power grid--has recently been introduced to improve efficiency of the traditional 20th century power grid. Smart grid provides a feasible way for dynamic and efficient power management of data centers.

### Function
- distributed energy production
- integration with mass number of renewable energy sources
- self monitoring
- demand response
- self healing
- the use of communication technology to precisely match power generation with consumer demand

### Smarter data center power management
- Improved reliability
  - The smart grid makes use of technologies for better **self-management and self healing** without any manual intervention. 
  - With the help of real-time monitoring devices the smart grid is able to reduce blackouts by automatically detecting the problems and immediately responding to errors on power line and **isolating the error-prone links** from the main pwoer network with minimum possible disruptions.
- Pricing and electricity and Power peak shaving.
    - Communication and metering technologies of smart grid inform smart devices used in the data centers to reduce their demand when energy demand is high in the regional market. 
    - In order to motivate the data center operators to cut their peak power demands, the electricity *price is increased during high demand* periods and decreased during low demand periods.
    - Consequently, data center operators are assumed to consume less during high demand periods as eventually they would see an economic gain by *using energy at off-demand periods*.
- Sustainability
  - Integration with **renewable energy** and distributed power generation of smart grid will play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  It is hoped that smart grid technology will allow the grid to better adapt to the dynamics of renewable energy sources.
  - Traditional power grid was designed for (unidirectional) delivery of power from centralized supply sources to feed fixed predictable loads which makes them hard to accept input energy from many distributed sources. By integrating information and communication technology (ICT) with electricity infrastructure, the smart grid will be easily able to accommodate **bidirectional power flows** and support many distributed feed-in points.
- Demand-side management
  - A smart grid incorporates smart equipments in the grid design, operation and communication. Such equipments can provide real-time information about data center operators electrical usage pattern. With the help of this information, the data center operator can better **manage their energy use and reduce energy costs**.
  - Advanced communication capabilities of the smart grid can provide data center operators to save energy and sell them. For example, the data center operator equipped with solar panels are allowed to **sell their excessive energy back to the grid**. Recently, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved Google Energy -- a subsidiary of Google Inc. -- to buy and sell energy on the whole sale markets, hence potential impacts of data center operations on smart grid have started already.

  
### Interaction of Power Grid and Data Centers
The interaction is *bilateral* and equally *beneficial* for both utilities.
- e.g., data centers may even earn some revenue by providing ancillary services to the power grids. 
  - Ancillary services: are mechanism/services used by the power grids to address normal variabilities in power consumption over time, and ensure resiliency in case of power plant or transmission line failures. When power grid is under stress due to high power demand, the networked data centers can shift their workload to other lower power demand region.
- in case of power failture data centers backup power generators and UPSs can be brought online to power grid and supply local energy.
