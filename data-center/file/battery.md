## Battery

### Purpose
Since the challenge of green energy is due to their uncertainty, i.e., it is always avaialbe, to mitigate this variability, datacenters could "bank" green energy in batteries, or on the grid itself(called **net metering**? `My comment: not very clear`).


### Reasons of not using battery
The approach of banking green energy in batteries or on the grid itself have many problem[[GreenHadoop-2012]](../../papers/GoiriL12_GreenHadoop.md).
