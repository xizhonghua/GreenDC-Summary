## Battery

### Purpose
Since the challenge of green energy is due to their uncertainty, i.e., it is always avaialbe, to mitigate this variability, datacenters could "bank" green energy in batteries, or on the grid itself(called **net metering**? `My comment: not very clear`).


### Reasons of not using battery
The approach of banking green energy in batteries or on the grid itself have many problem[[GreenHadoop-2012]](../../papers/GoiriL12_GreenHadoop.md). Given theese problems, *Inigo et al.* argue that the best way to take full advantage of the available green energy is to match the energy demand to the energy supply.

- batteries incur energy losses due to internal resistance and self-discharge
- battery-related costs can dominate in solar-powered system [[Joseen-2004]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X03004699)
- battries use chameicals that are harmful to the environment
- net metering incurs losses due to voltage transformation involved in feeding the green energy into the grid
- net metering in unvailable in many parts of the world
- where net metring is available, the power company may pay less than the retial electricity price for the green energy.
