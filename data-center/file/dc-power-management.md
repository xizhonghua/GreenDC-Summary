### Power Budget
- Some power budgeting approaches consider the heterogenous set of applications and divide total power caps based on application peroperties [[Rajamani-2006]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4086132&tag=1) [[Zhan-2013]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2488951).

### Job Scheduling
- Job scheduling impacts the power and performance of dta centers, and therefore, has been extensively studies. First-in first out (FIFO) policy is widely used strategy today because of its simplicaity and fairness. Back-filling is another popular strategy aiming to improve system utilization [[Mualem-2001]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=380315).
