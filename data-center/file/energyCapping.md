Energy Capping
----

### Benefits
- Many data centers use power capping to reduce the total power consumption. 
- This approach allow administrators to plan data centers more efficiently to avoid the risk of overloading existing power supplies. 
- Placing caps on large brown energy consumer like data centers can help business, utilities, and societies deal with carbon footprint challenges. 

### How
- The data center administrateor can set a threshold of powr consumpton to limit the actual power of the data center [[Fan-2007]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1250665). 
- The total power consumption is kept under a predefined power budget so that unexpected rise in power can be prevented.
- Placing caps on the amount of energy used. When a service exceeds the cap, it must either purchase carbon offsets corresponding to its excess consumption (**cap-and-trade**) or start paying higher electricity prices(**cap-and-pay**). 
- The cap may be government-imposed, utility-imposed or voluntarily-set.
