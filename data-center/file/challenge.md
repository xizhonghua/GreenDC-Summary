## Data Center Power Management Challenge


### Challenges
- [Renewable Energy](./greenEnergy.md)
- [Dynamic Energy Price](./energyPrice.md)
- Workloads uncertainty

### Summary
- The challenge is the significant mismatch between workloads and green energy supply. When the workload is at its peak, green energy supply somtimes can be nearly zero, and vice versa. 
- This mismatch challenges the utilization of green energy and thus potentially increases the brown energy usage.

### Renewable Energy Trend
- Renewable sources amounted to about 12% of the US electricity production in 2012 (based on data from the US Energy Information Administration). Globally, the figutres are not much better with the execption of a few European contries. One of the reasons for limited renewable adoption is related to the challenge in real-time matching of supply and demand in the grid. This already significant challenge is tremendously growing because of 
  - the intermittent nature of renewable energy and
  - the lack of large scale, green energy storage solutions.
