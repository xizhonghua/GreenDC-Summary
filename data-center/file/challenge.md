## Data Center Power Management Challenge


### Challenges
- [Renewable Energy](./greenEnergy.md)
- [Dynamic Energy Price](./energyPrice.md)
- Workloads uncertainty

### Summary
- The challenge is the significant mismatch between workloads and green energy supply. When the workload is at its peak, green energy supply somtimes can be nearly zero, and vice versa. 
- This mismatch challenges the utilization of green energy and thus potentially increases the brown energy usage.
