### Green Eenergy
- It is challenging to use the green energy, unlike the "brown" (carbon-intensive) energy drawn from the electrical grid, they are not always available.
- This means that energy demand and supply must be matched, if we are to take full advantage of the green energy to minimize brown energy consumption.
