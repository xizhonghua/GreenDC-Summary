### Green Eenergy
- The major challenge with solar or wind energy is that, unlike brown energy drawn from the grid, it is not always available. For example, photovoltaic(PV) solar energy is only available during the day and the amount produced depends on the weather and the season.
- This means that energy demand and supply must be matched, if we are to take full advantage of the green energy to minimize brown energy consumption.
