Data Center Intro
----


### Introduction of Data Center
- Datacenters range from small numbers of servers in machine rooms to thousands of servers housed in warehouse-size installation [[Govindan-2012]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2150985).
- Data centers have been the key system infrastructure for cloud computing. Many IT companies such as Google and Microsoft have multiple geographically distributed data centers.

### Green Data Center
- Datacenters partially or completely powered by renewables such as solar or wind energy. These datacenters will either generate their own renewable energy(**self-generation**) or draw it directly from an existing nearby plant(co-location).

### Green Energy
- Solar/wind equipment produces Direct Current(DC) electricity, which is typically convereted to Alternating Current(AC) by DC/AC converters.
