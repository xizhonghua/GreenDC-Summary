### Simulation Setup for Internet Data Centers (IDC)

### Setup
- Ref: [[Rahman-2014]](../../papers/RahmanLK14_Survey-Geo-LoadBalancing.md)
- Workload
  - We assume that the workload distributed from five frong-end elements to three back-end IDCs (located in three different locations: Wisconsin, Michigan and Atlanta) are 30000, 15000, 15000, 20000, 20000 requests per second which totals up to 10^5 requests per second. 
  - The delay constarint D = 1ms
- Server
  - Each server cosnumes same amount of power which is 120 Watts.
  - The processing speed at each of the three IDCs are 2.0, 1.25 and 1.75 requests per second, respectively.
  - The three IDCS are equipped with 20000, 60000, and 25000 servers, respectively.
