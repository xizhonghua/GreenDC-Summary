## Green Energy Self Generation/Colocation


### Self Generation
Self-generation is attractive for multiple reasons, includeing
- the fact that energy losses with power transformation and transmission can exceed 40%
- the ability to survive grid outages, which are common in some developing contries `My comments: not very clear`
- the fact that PV power scales poorly, as the cost/W does not decerase beyond 800KW(the maximum inverter size today [[SMA-2012]](http://www.sma-america.com/en_US/products/grid-tied-inverters/sunny-central/sunny-central-500cp-xt-630cp-xt-720cp-xt-760cp-xt-800cp-xt-850cp-xt-900cp-xt.html). `My comments: not very clear`
- the ability to eventually lower costs



### Co-location
