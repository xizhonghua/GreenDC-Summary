## Green Energy Self Generation/Colocation


### Self Generation
Self-generation is attractive for multiple reasons, including
- the fact that energy losses with power transformation and transmission can exceed 40%
- the ability to survive grid outages, which are common in some developing contries `My comments: not very clear`
- the fact that PV power scales poorly, as the cost/W does not decerase beyond 800KW(the maximum inverter size today [[SMA-2012]](http://www.sma-america.com/en_US/products/grid-tied-inverters/sunny-central/sunny-central-500cp-xt-630cp-xt-720cp-xt-760cp-xt-800cp-xt-850cp-xt-900cp-xt.html). `My comments: not very clear`
- the ability to eventually lower costs
- according to the results in [[Goiri-2012]](../../papers/GoiriL12_GreenHadoop.md) and the govenment incentives in New Jersey, the current capital cost of installing solar panels for the datacenter we model can be amortized by savings in brown energy cost in 10.6 years. This amortized periods is substaintially shorter than the typical 20-30 years lifetime of the panels. The period will eventually be even shorter in the future, as solar costs continue to decrease at a rapid pace [[SolarBuzz]](http://www.solarbuzz.com/)
