## Renewable Energy

### Renewable Source
- Wind
- Rain
- Sun
- Tides
- Geothermal hear

### Characteristic
- Uncertainty of renewable energy sources
    - An effective way to maximize renewable energy usage is to schedule data center's workload when renewable energy is available.
    - However, the amount of availability of power generated from renewable source is completely weather dependent which makes scheduling a very difficult. 
    - Moreover, the intermittancy and variability of reneables require much more complicated forecasting.
- Storage capacity of renewable energy sources
    - The renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy is highly dynamic and intermittent.
    - Therefore, a very large capacity storage is required to store the produced power from renewable sources during their availability period so that the stored energy could be used during their unavailability period.
    - How to effectively reduce the capacity requirement for storing renewable energy is a challenging power management task.
- Difficulties in integrating renewable energy
    - Renewable energy sites are usually located in remote areas with limited transmission capacity; distant sites also create increased transmission loss.
    - Therefore, distributing workload for maximizing renewable energy utilization is not always easy to achieve.
 
### Prediction
- The production of green energy is very susceptible to environmental changes. This limits the use of green energy in time-sensitive applications. Prediction can reduce the uncertainty of the available resources, allowing end-users to scale demand with the predicted supply. [[Aksanli-2011]](papers/AksanliVZR11_mixed-batch-service.md).
