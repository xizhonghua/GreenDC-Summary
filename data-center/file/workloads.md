## Workload Types


### Task-aware workloads
- Ref: [[Dogar-2014]](https://github.com/hxwang/GreenDC-Summary/blob/master/papers/DogarK14_SIGCOMM_Decentralized-TaskScheduling-for-DCN.md)
- Today's dat center applications perform rich and complex tassks, such as answering a search query or building a user's social news-feed.
- These tasks involve hundreds and thousands of components, all of which need to finish before a tasks is considered complete.
- This has motivated efforts to allocate data center resources in a **"task-aware"** fashion. Examples includes task-aware allocation of caches[[PACMan-2012]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2228326), network bandwidth[[Chowdhury]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2018448), and CPU and network[[Ananthanarayanan]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1924962)
