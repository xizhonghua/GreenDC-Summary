## Deadline


### Intro
Many applications in real world require delay bound or deadline constraint [[Lee-2007]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1272381). 
- When combine with energy conservation, deadline is usually a critical adjusting tool beween performance loss and energy consumption. 
- Energy efficient deadline scheduing was first studied by [[Yao-1995]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=492493&tag=1). They proposed algorithms, which aim to minimize energy consumption for independent jobs with deadline constraints on a single varianble-speed processor.

### Current research situation 
- In the context of greendata center, most work on energy management merely talk about minimizing the average delay but not give any bound on delay until recently.
