## Heterogenous workload

### Why has heterogeneous workload
- With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, research centers and enterprises have started to outsourcing their IT and computational needs to on-demand cloud services [[Buyya]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X08001957). 


### Characteristic

### How current solutions deal with heterogenous workload
- Give higher priority to web server jobs. 
  - [[Zhan-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6205737): Web server requests require an immediate response, thus they have higher priority. While batch jobs can be queued when resource is not available.

### Evidence of heterogeneous workload
- Search engine systems, like Nutch(http://nutch.apache.org/), include two major heterogenous workloads: Map-Reduce like parallel data analysis and search engine services. [[Zhan-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6205737)
- The Boeing company also reported this trend of consolidating parallel batch jobs and web service applications on one data center in the recent IDC HPC user forum, held in October 30, 2010 at Beijing, China.
