## Job size

### Batch jobs
- Data centers also have longer running batch jobs (on the order of tens of minutes [[Kavulya-2010]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5493490)).
- The performance is measured in terms of throughput and job completion times instead of latency guarantees (e.g., web crawling, index update in search engines, web log analysis [[Tang-2009]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1855834)).

### Job size distribution
- the log of job size satisfy normal, gamma distribution, according to [GWA-T-11 LCG](http://gwa.ewi.tudelft.nl/datasets/gwa-t-10-sharcnet/report/)
