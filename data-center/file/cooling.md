## Cooling

### Motivation
Each data center has colling facilities to avoid overheating in its equipments.

### Cooling energy
The cooling energy consumption depends on 
- the data center utilization 
- the cooling strategies
  - there are a series of discrete levels in cooling strategies (whether a chiller is one or off, a certain level in fan speed, whether air is circulated through chiller).
  - Ensentially, the cooling strategies form multiple levels of cooling energy usage, and transitions among different levels result in the energy consumption.
- outside temperature
  - to keep the data center below the predefined temperature, a higher outside temperature generally requires more cooling energy.
