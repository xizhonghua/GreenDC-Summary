Power Concern
---

### Electricity cost concern
- Servers today consume ten times more power than they did ten years ago [[Epa-2007]](https://github.com/hxwang/GreenDC-Summary/blob/master/US-EPA-Report-on-Server-and-Data-Center-Energy-Efficiency.md).
- According to Dr. Eric Schmidt, ECO of Google, "what matters most to the computer designer at Google is not speed, but power, low power, because data centers can consume as much electricity as a city [[Markoff-2009]](https://github.com/hxwang/GreenDC-Summary/blob/master/MarkoffL02_Intel's-Huge-Bet-Turns-Iffy.md)."
- Estimates for 2010 indicate that collectively data centers consume around 1.5% of the total electricity used world-wide [[Koomey-2011]](http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html).
- Recent studies show that large-scale data centers consumed about 1.3% of all electricity use of the world, and 2% of all electricity usage for the United States in the year of 2010 [[Koomey-2011]](http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html).
- A high performance computing(HPC) center with 1000 racks and about 25000 square feet requires 100MW of energy for the computing infrastructure and an additional 5MW to remove the dissipated heat [[Patel-2003]](http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1589423).
- As of 2006, the data centers in the United States were consuming 61.4 billion kWh per year [[Goiri-2011]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6114408&tag=1), an amount of energy equivalent to that consumed by the entire transportation  manufacturing industry ( the industry that makes airplanes, ships, cars, trucks, and other means of transportation) [[Jossen-2004]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X03004699)

### Money cost concern
- The wordwide expenditure on enterprise power and cooling of these servers is estimated to be in excess of $30 billion [[Raghavendra-2009]](https://github.com/hxwang/GreenDC-Summary/blob/master/RaR08-No-Power-Struggles-Coordinated-Multi-Level-Management-for-the-Data-Center.md)
- A crude estimation of annual server electricity bill based on publicly disclosed/leaked information, conventional server energy models, and back-of-the-envelope calculations is given in [[Qureshi-2009]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1592584). For instance, popular operators such as eBay, Rackspace, Facebook, Microsoft, Google's estimated annual utility bills are $10M, $20M, $25M, >$75M and >$135M respectively. 

### Environmental concern
- The high electricity cost translates into high carbon emissions as most of this electricity comes from fossile fuels. 
- When electricity is produced from burning coal, natural gas or petroleum, a significant amount of C)<sub>2</sub> emission takes place. Being a significant consumer of energy, data centers are estimated to generate a carbon footprint in the hundreds of mission of tonnes -- equivalent to a large industrialized country.
- A recently disclosure from Google Inc. reveals the fact that it emits 1.5 million tonnes of carbon annually [[Clark-2011]](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/08/google-carbon-footprint). Some more threatening facts about Google users are as follows. Each search carried out on the google website has in indirect carbon footprint of 7 gram of CO<sub>2</sub>, each 10 minutes of viewing in Youtube generates 1 gram of CO<sub>2</sub> and a typical Gmail user is responsible for producing 1.2 kilogram of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. In total, a typical Google user creates 1.46 kilogram of CO<sub>2</sub> by consuming its various services. 


### Trend
- As the price of server hardware has remained relatively stable, energy cost becomes one of the primary components in the total cost of ownership for computer server systems in the data centers. 
- Since the cost of powring HPC systems has been steadily rising with growing performance, while the cost of hardware has remained relatively stable, it is argued that if these trends were to continue, the energy cost of a large-scale system during its lifetime could surpass the equipment itself [[Fan-2007]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1250665).
