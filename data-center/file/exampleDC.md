## Green Data Center in Real Life

### Green data centers examples
- Apple and McGraw-Hill have built large solar arrays for their datacenters, whereas Green House Data is a small cloud provider that operates entirely on renewables. [[Goiri-2013]](https://github.com/hxwang/GreenDC-Summary/blob/master/papers/GoiriIK13_Designing-and-Managing-Datacenters-Powered-by-Renewable-Energy.md)
- Many small and dedium datacenters(partically or completely) powered by solar and/or wind energy are being built all over the world [[Green-webhost]](http://www.ecobusinesslinks.com/green_webhosts/). 


### Data center size
- Smaller compnanies/insttutes possess in-hour data centers that are usually built within large data commercial buildings. Bigger companies usually build their data centers on(possibly remote) independent building infrastructure that can be up to several hundred thousand square feet in size and solely dedicated for hosting computing peripherals.
- Moreover, large companies may contain tens or even hundreds of data centers. 
- As the number and size of data centers grow throughout the world, especially following the wider adoption of cloud services, a number of researchers start focusing on powr management and energy efficiency at the data center level [[Chen-2014]](../../papers/Chen14-IGCC-participate-in-grid.md).


### Data center energy consumption
- A small data center may consume power as high as tens of kilowatts(kWs) whereas peak power usage of a large data center can be tens of megawatts(MWs)

### Cost of building green data center
trend: keep reducing
- The technology's captical costs continue to decrease (e.g., the cost of solar energy decreased by 7-fold in the last two decades [[SolarBuzz]](http://www.solarbuzz.com/).
- Govenment continue to provide incentive for green powe generation and use (e.g., federal and state incentives in New Jersey can reduce capital cost by 60% [[DSIRE]](http://www.dsireusa.org/)


### Power management trend
trend: small companies still suffer
- Large Internet companies (e.g., Google and Microsoft) have significantly improved the energy efficiency of their multimegawatt datacenters. Howerver, the majority of the energy consumed by datacenters is actually due to countless small and medium-sized ones [[USEPA-2007]](http://hightech.lbl.gov/documents/data_centers/epa-datacenters.pdf).
