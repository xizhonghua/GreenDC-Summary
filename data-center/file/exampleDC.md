## Green Data Center in Real Life

### Green Data Centers Examples
- Apple and McGraw-Hill have built large solar arrays for their datacenters, whereas Green House Data is a small cloud provider that operates entirely on renewables. [[Goiri-2013]](https://github.com/hxwang/GreenDC-Summary/blob/master/papers/GoiriIK13_Designing-and-Managing-Datacenters-Powered-by-Renewable-Energy.md)
- Many small and dedium datacenters(partically or completely) powered by solar and/or wind energy are being built all over the world [[Green-webhost]](http://www.ecobusinesslinks.com/green_webhosts/). 



### Power Management Trend
- Large Internet companies (e.g., Google and Microsoft) have significantly improved the energy efficiency of their multimegawatt datacenters. Howerver, the majority of the energy consumed by datacenters is actually due to countless small and medium-sized ones [[USEPA-2007]](http://hightech.lbl.gov/documents/data_centers/epa-datacenters.pdf).
