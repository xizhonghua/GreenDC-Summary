## Smart Grid


### Definition


### Function 
Smart Grid provides a feasible way for dynamic and efficient power management of data centers. 
- distributed energy production
- integration with mass number of renewable energy sources
- self monitorng
- demand response
- self healing 
- the use of communication technology to precisely match power generation with consumer demand. 


### Smart Grid v.s. Data Center
- Data center can benefit from the real-time states of the grid and to use cheap energy etc.
- Data centers may even earn some revenue by providing ancillary services to the power grids. 
  - Aucillary services are mechanisms/services uded by the power grids to address normal variability in power consumption over time, and ensure resiliency in case of power plant or transmission line failure.
