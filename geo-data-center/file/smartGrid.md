## Smart Grid


### Definition


### Function 
Smart Grid provides a feasible way for dynamic and efficient power management of data centers. 
- distributed energy production
- integration with mass number of renewable energy sources
- self monitorng
- demand response
- self healing 
- the use of communication technology to precisely match power generation with consumer demand. 


### Smart Grid v.s. Data Center
The interaction between smart grid and data center operators is bilateral and equally beneficial for both the entities.

##### Benefits of Data Center
- Data center can benefit from the real-time states of the grid such as power price, power demand, power availability, etc.

##### Benefits of Smart Grid 
- Data centers may even earn some revenue by providing ancillary services to the power grids. 
  - Aucillary services are mechanisms/services uded by the power grids to address normal variability in power consumption over time, and ensure resiliency in case of power plant or transmission line failure.
- When power grid is under stress due to high power demand, the networked data centers can shift their workload to other low power demand region. `My comments: not very clear`
- In case of power failure data centers backup power generator and UPSs can be brought online to the power grid and supply local energy.
