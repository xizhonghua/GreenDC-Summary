Data Center
----


### Definition
Datacenters range from small numbers of servers in machine rooms to thousands of servers housed in warehouse-size installation [Govindan-2012](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2150985).


### Green Data Centers
Datacenters partially or completely powered by renewables such as solar or wind energy. These datacenters will either generate their own renewable energy(**self-generation**) or draw it directly from an existing nearby plant(co-location). For example
  - Apple and McGraw-Hill have built large solar arrays for their datacenters, whereas Green House Data is a small cloud provider that operates entirely on renewables.
