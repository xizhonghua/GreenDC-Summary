### Summary
In this paper, an online algorithm for migrating jobs between data cneters based on electricity price differentials is proposed. While migrating a job from one data center to antoher data center they focus on live migration model where the application's state and data need to be migrated together to the destination data center. Therefore, job migration is not free and comes with an associated nontrivial bandwidth cost.
- Their work differs from other works in a way that they are the first to incorporate bandwidth cost in this type of electricity cost minimization optimization problem.
- Secondly, their framework also considers existence of multiple energy sources per data center, thereby they generalized the energy availability and cost model of other works.
- Finally, their algorithm makes migraiton decision not only basedon current saving but also considering the future sequences.
