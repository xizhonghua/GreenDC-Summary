## [Priority Algorithm for Near-data Scheduling: Throughput and Heavy-Traffic Optimality](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~qxie3/uploads/4/6/8/9/46891789/near-data-infocom-2015.pdf)


### Summary
- In this paper, the authors propose a simple "local-tasks first" priority algorithm and show that it is throughput-optimal and heavy-traffic optimal for all traffic scenarios.

### TODO
- I briefly scaned the proofs and didn't go into details.
