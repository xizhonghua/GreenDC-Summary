### Problem Statement
- Tasks in modern data-parallel clusters have high diverse resoruce requirements along CPU, memor, disk and network. 
- Thus, a multi-resource cluster scheduler is needed, which will be responsible for packing tasks to machines based on their requirements of all resource types. With the following objective
 - avoids resource fragmentation
 - avoid over-allocation of the resources that are not explicitly allocated

### Problem Model
- Task arrivals and machine availability change in an online manner and wherein task's resource needs change with time and with the machine that the task is placed at.
