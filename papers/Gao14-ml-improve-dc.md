### Comments
- This blog and white paper conduct machine learning to learn the IT load, cooling temperature and server etc to predict PUE. 
  - Pros: This prediction can guide the energy saving by changing the IT load, cooling temperature and server to minimize energy consumption.
  - Cons: However, they do not really guide how to assign workload to servers. Thus, how to combine machine learning to job scheduling still demand research.
