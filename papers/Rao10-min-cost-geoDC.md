### Summary
In this paper, the authors study the electricity cost minimization problem considering the spatial and temporal diversity of price while guaranteeing quality of service (QoS) requirements. 
- At first, tjey provide fundamental models for the total electricity cost, load constrain and end-to-end delay constraint for data centers. 
- Based on these models, they formualte the electricity cost minimization problem as a constrainted mixed-integer programming problem where the constraints capture the service delay guarantee and workload requirements.
- Brenner's effcient fast polynomial time [[Brenner-2008]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2284047) is used to optimally solve the problem.
