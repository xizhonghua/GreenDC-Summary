## [Yao's Principle](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/egrigore/Fall12/lect20.pdf)

- [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao's_principle)

### Summary
- Yao's principle states that the expected cost of a randomized algorithm on the worst case input, is no better than a worst-case random probability distribution of the deterministic algorithm which performs best for that distribution.
- confused.


### Main Idea
- Objective: to analyze the lower bound of randomized algorithm.
- Approach: it is sufficient to look at the deterministic algorithm.
- My idea: the lower bound of randomized algorithm is no better than the best performance of the worst-case performance of any deterministic algorithm.
