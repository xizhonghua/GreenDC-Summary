## [Yao's Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao's_principle)

### Summary
- Yao's principle states that the expected cost of a randomized algorithm on the worst case input, is no better than a worst-case random probability distribution of the deterministic algorithm which performs best for that distribution.
