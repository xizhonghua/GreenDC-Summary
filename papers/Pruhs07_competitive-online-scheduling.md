### Summary


### Model
- Server
 - speed s
- Job J<sub>i</sub>
 - release time r<sub>i</sub>
 - work p<sub>i</sub>, thus processing time demand is p<sub>i</sub>/s
 - completition time C<sub>i</sub>
 - preemption is allowed
- Quality of Service(QoS) measures
 - response of a job is: F<sub>i</sub> = C<sub>i</sub> - r<sub>i</sub>
 - slowdown of a job is: S<sub>i</sub> = F<sub>i</sub>/p<sub>i</sub>
  - e.g., a job with slowdown 2 behaves as though it was served by a dedicated speed 1/2 server.
 
 
### Technique
- **Competitive ratio**
 - Definition: *max A(I)/Opt(I) &le; c*, for any input instance I
    - A(I): the QoS measure of the schedule produced by algorithm A on input I
    - Opt(I) is the optimal QoS value
 - Explain: Since the competitive ratio is a worst-case concept, one generally thinks of the competitive ratio as the pay-off of a game played between the *online scheduling algorithm A* and the *adversary*
    - Algorithm A's move at time t is to specify the job that it will run
    - Adversary's move at time t is to specify the jobs that arrive at time t
    - The payoff of the game is then essentiallly the relative different between the QoS measurement of A's schedule and the QoS measure of the optimal schedule
- **Local Competitive Argument**: one way to prove competitive ratio
 - Procedure
   - Let A(t) be the increase of the QoS measure for algorithm A at time t for some understood input I
      - e.g., If QoS measure was average response time, then A(t) is the number of jobs released but unfinished at time t
      - e.g., If QoS measure was average slowdown, then A(t) is the number of jobs released but unfinished by A at time t divided by the aggregate workload of these jobs. `My comment: not very clear`
    - An algorithm A is locally c-competitive if for all inputs I, and all time t, it is the case that A(t) &le; c*Opt(t)
 - Example: SRPT is optimal for average response 
    - Shortest Remaining Processing Time(SRPT)
    - one needs to show that at all times, SPRT always has the least possible number of unfinished jobs
 - Example: SRPT is 2-competitive for average slowdown
   - one needs to show that at all times t, SPRT is at most twice optimal with respect to the objective of minimizing the number of unfinished jobs at time t divided by the work of these jobs

### Clairvoyant online algorithm
 - Definition: It requires knowledge of the jobs
  - e.g., Clairvoyantï¼š SPRT requires knowledge of the work of the jobs 
  - e.g., NonClairvoyant: Shortest Elapsed Time First(SETF) runs the jobs that runs the least so far.
