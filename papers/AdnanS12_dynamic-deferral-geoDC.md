### Summary
In this paper, the authors study the problem of workloads schedule among geographic data centers aiming at minimizing cost while meeting deadlines.
- They present an offline formulation.
- They design an online algorithm to determine the assignment of worklod to data center. Simulation results demonstrated their proposed mechanism can achieve 20-30% cost-savings.


### Model
##### Workloads
- latency: bounded delay
##### Cloud
- In cloud computing, each center of execution (data center) are usually located in different geographic locations which are often in different time zones.
