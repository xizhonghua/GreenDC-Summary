### Summary
In the paper, the author offers an evolutionary path to solving the incompatibility problem in CS publishing culture.

### Current CS Journal
- Top-level researchers seldom publish in journals
- The papers are often a complete version of the ones that have already been published in conference proceedings.

### Problem
- People outside CS may misunderstand.
  - e.g., a CS guy with even no journal papers but many conference papers could be in professor position.
- Unable for bibliometry evaluation
  - bibliometry is used to evaluate researchers. e.g., when evaluating the departments, schools, universities
  - bibliometry is done using the standard journal database, thus cs conference papers are invisible.

### Solution
- CS should switch as soon as possible to publishing in journals, but in combination with conferences.
- CS journal can be divided into two types
  - one is for rapid publication: traditional CS conference publications can be published in this track.
  - one is for 
- CS conference
  - keep it, but some kind of merge of conferences with journal is needed
  - e.g., the merge of International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) with the journal THeory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
  - alternative approach: conference recommends paper to journal
