### Summary
In this paper, the author design decentralized task-aware scheduling approach that could reduce both the **average** as well as **tail completion time** for typical data center applications.

### Model
- workloads: task aware workloads


### Strongness

### Weakness

### Extension
- how it compared to non-task-aware scheduling
	- I guess when some completion time of some jobs reduce, some will increase
