## Immediate Dispatch

### Definition
- Immediate dispatch, `My comment: it seems non-migration`
    - An online scheduling algorithm has the immediate dispatch property if it assigns a job J<sub>i</sub> to a server at time r<sub>i</sub>, and all jobs are processed exclusively on the server that they are assigned.
    - Immediate dispatch might be desirable for example if you had a load balancer sitting in front of a server farm, and migrations of jobs between servers was undesirable.
