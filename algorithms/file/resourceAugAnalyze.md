## How to Analyaze with Resource Augmentation

### Procedure
My summary from paper [[Pruhs-2010]](../../papers/PruhsS10_schedule-energy.md)
- First, create an lower bound instance.
- Then, refecting on this lower bound instance, once notices that if the processors used by the online algorithm were only slightly more energy efficient, then the online algorithm could be competitive on this instances.


### Example
- Greedy is 1-competitive 2-speed
  - from Fei.
