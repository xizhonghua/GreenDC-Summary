## Definition of Randomized Online Algorithms

### Definition
- Randomizedonline algorithm are compared against an *oblivious adversary* that must specify the input before the online algorithm begins.
  - If the adversary is allowed to change the future input in response to the random events internal to the scheduling algorithm, then generally randomization is not so helpful to the online algorithm.
