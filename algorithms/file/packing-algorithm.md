## 2D Packing
Allocate a set of rectangular items to large rectangular standardized units by minimizing the waste.
- 2D dimensional bin packing
 - these units are finite rectangles
- 2D dimensional strip packing
 - there is a single standardized unit of given width 
 - the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height
