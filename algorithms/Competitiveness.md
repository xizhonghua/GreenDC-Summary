Competitiveness
---

### Definition


### Why use it
- The standard measure of goodness of an online algorithm is competitiveness, which is this setting is, roughly speaking, the worst-case, over all possible inputs, of the relative error betweeen the optimal profit and the profit achieved by the online algorithm. One generally seeks algorithms that are competitive, that is, where this relative error is *bounded*. The motivation of seeking competitive algorithm is that if the online algorithm achieve very little profit, then it must be because great profit was not achievable, and not because the algorithm was at fault
